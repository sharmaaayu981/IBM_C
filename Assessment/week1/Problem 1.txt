## Problem 1  
Build an application with the following features:  
	- User wants to get login and provides email-id and password via console.  
	- User data will be delegated to Business layer for validation.  
		- email-id and password must not be null or empty.  
		- email-id must be valid email id.  
		- Password must have at least 8 characters.  
		- If above scenarios are not fulfilled, throw custom exception with proper message otherwise continue.  
	- After validation is done, user data will be delegated to dao layer for authentication.  
		- Already 5 users are stored (use array as your database here)  
		- If email-id is not found, throw exception with message "Invalid email-id".  
		- If email-id found but password is not correct, throw exception with message "Invalid password"  
		- If email-id and password are correct, return user.  
	- In all scenarios, User must see all the info in his screen.   

Class User -> name, email-id, password, age
